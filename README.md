# 🔓 WPA2 Educational Attack – Capture & Crack

This project demonstrates a dictionary attack on WPA2-protected Wi-Fi networks using ethical hacking techniques in a controlled test environment. It includes two main scripts: one for setting up an Alfa wireless adapter and another for automating the attack process. The project focuses on the well-known vulnerability of WPA2 networks to deauthentication and dictionary attacks. While the attack itself is widely recognized and will only be briefly covered, the primary goal is to explore how it can be optimized and accelerated through scripting and automation.

## 📁 Contents

- `setup_alfa_monitor_mode.sh` – Bash script to configure a wireless adapter (e.g. Alfa AWUS036NHA) into monitor mode
- `wpa2_auto_attack.py` – Python script to automate:
  - Network scanning
  - Target selection
  - Deauthentication attack
  - Capturing the WPA2 handshake
  - Cracking using a wordlist and `aircrack-ng`
- In addition, there is a script called dictionary_hash.py, which will pre-hash the wordlist to speed up the dictionary attack.

## 🧠 How WPA2 Works and Why It's Vulnerable

WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II) is a security standard for wireless networks that uses encryption to protect data transmitted between devices (clients) and the router (access point). This encryption uses algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), providing a high level of security. When a device (such as a laptop or smartphone) connects to the network, a 4-way handshake takes place. This is a process where the device and the router exchange certain packets to verify that both sides are authentic without directly transmitting the password. The password entered when connecting to the network is not sent in plain text. Instead, it's used to generate a key (the Pairwise Master Key - PMK) that is used to encrypt the traffic. The 4-way handshake process is also used to create this key. After a successful 4-way handshake, communication between the device and the router is encrypted using a dynamically generated key. This secures all the data transmitted over the network.

The key vulnerability of WPA2 is that the 4-way handshake can be intercepted when a device connects to the network. An attacker can listen for these packets and capture them. This allows the attacker to perform an attack later using a dictionary attack to discover the password, without knowing it beforehand. WPA2 is not only vulnerable because of the password but also because an attacker can use a dictionary of possible passwords to perform a brute-force attack on the PMK (the password in hashed form). The ability to use pre-recorded wordlists makes the attack fast and efficient when a handshake has been captured. Many users choose easy-to-guess or common passwords, which makes attacks more successful.

## 🚀 Attack Flow (in a test environment)

1. Scan for available WPA2 Wi-Fi networks
2. Select a target network (BSSID and channel)
3. Put the adapter into monitor mode
4. Deauthenticate a connected client
5. Capture the WPA2 4-way handshake
6. Use a wordlist to try cracking the password
